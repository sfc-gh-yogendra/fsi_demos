# Glacier First Bank — Demo Standards

## Overview
This rule defines demo-specific standards and patterns. All configuration values are in `config.py` - this rule provides the standards and patterns for demonstration scenarios.

## Demo Scope (Core Scenarios)
- **Scenarios**: 
  1. AML/KYC Enhanced Due Diligence
  2. Credit Risk Analysis
  3. Transaction Monitoring & Alert Triage
  4. Periodic KYC Reviews
  5. Network Analysis for TBML Detection
- **Integration Focus**: Cross-domain intelligence through shared vendor relationships, ML-based triage, and graph-based network analysis
- **Demonstration Goal**: Show comprehensive AI-powered financial crime compliance across the complete AML/KYC lifecycle with quantified efficiency gains

## Demo Flow Standards
- **Story Structure**: 3-4 conversational turns per scenario
- **Turn Pattern**: User question → Agent analysis → Follow-up → Deeper insight
- **Timing Target**: ~15 minutes per scenario (not cumulative)
- **Multi-tool Usage**: Agents should demonstrate both search and analytical capabilities

## Agent Response Standards

### Citation Requirements
- Include source document ID/title with dates
- State currency, time period, and filters
- Provide data freshness indicators

### Risk Flagging Pattern
- ⚠️ **WARNING**: Approaching threshold
- 🚨 **BREACH**: Threshold exceeded
- Always include specific metric value and threshold

### Visualization Patterns
When user implies need for visual analysis:
- **Trends**: Suggest line chart
- **Comparisons**: Suggest bar chart
- **Composition**: Suggest stacked chart
- **Distribution**: Suggest histogram
- **KPI**: Inline value with severity color

## Tool Selection Logic
- **Quantitative questions** → Cortex Analyst on semantic views
- **Document questions** → Cortex Search services
- **Comprehensive analysis** → Both tools with synthesis
- **SQL visibility** → Only on explicit user request

## Risk Threshold Standards
Demo uses EU/EBA-style thresholds (defined in config.py):
- Financial ratios with warning/breach levels
- Concentration limits for risk management
- Time-based monitoring requirements

## Document Taxonomy Patterns
### AML/KYC Documents
- Types: Onboarding, Adverse Media, PEP/Sanctions, Internal
- Risk Signals: Low, Medium, High
- Standard Attributes: id, title, content, entity_name, doc_type, date

### Credit Documents  
- Types: Business Plans, Financial Statements, Policy Documents
- Standard Attributes: id, title, content, applicant_name, doc_type, date

See patterns in respective implementation guides.

## Demo Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] All 5 scenarios complete 3-4 turn demo flow
- [ ] Tool orchestration works correctly across all scenarios
- [ ] Cross-domain intelligence demonstrated
- [ ] ML-based alert triage operational (Scenario 3)
- [ ] Automated change detection working (Scenario 4)
- [ ] Network analysis identifies shell companies (Scenario 5)

### Data Quality
- [ ] Citations include source and date
- [ ] Thresholds flagged with severity (⚠️/🚨)
- [ ] Currency and time periods stated
- [ ] Alert data includes priority scores and disposition history
- [ ] Entity relationships include shared directors and addresses
- [ ] Customer review dates properly calculated

### Technical Validation  
- [ ] Search services return relevant results
- [ ] Semantic views aggregate correctly (5 views total)
  - [ ] aml_kyc_risk_sv with review date dimensions
  - [ ] credit_risk_sv
  - [ ] transaction_monitoring_sv with ML priority scores
  - [ ] network_analysis_sv with shared characteristics
  - [ ] Supporting curated views
- [ ] Agent audit trail available
- [ ] Performance within demo targets (<15 min per scenario)

### Demo Readiness
- [ ] Compelling "wow moments" identified for all 5 scenarios
- [ ] Smooth narrative flow across extended scope
- [ ] Clear value proposition with quantified efficiency gains
  - [ ] EDD: 4-6 hrs → 15-20 mins
  - [ ] Credit: 2-3 days → 2-3 hrs
  - [ ] Alert Investigation: 4-6 hrs → 30-45 mins
  - [ ] Periodic Reviews: 45-60 mins → <1 min (6-7x multiplier)
  - [ ] Network Analysis: weeks → hours
- [ ] No technical hiccups

### New Scenario-Specific Validation
- [ ] **Transaction Monitoring**: ALERT_STRUCT_001 exists with 95% priority score
- [ ] **Transaction Monitoring**: Network connection to Global Parts LLC identified
- [ ] **Periodic Reviews**: 15 customers due, 12 low-touch, 3 manual
- [ ] **Periodic Reviews**: Nordic Industries S.A. has no material changes
- [ ] **Network Analysis**: 5-entity shell network with Anya Sharma as shared director
- [ ] **Network Analysis**: Gibraltar address shared across all 5 entities
- [ ] **Network Analysis**: Circular vendor relationships formed
