# Glacier First Bank — Phase 1 Standards

## Overview
This rule defines Phase 1 specific standards and patterns. All configuration values are in `config.py` - this rule provides the standards and patterns unique to Phase 1.

## Phase 1 Scope
- **Scenarios**: AML/KYC Enhanced Due Diligence + Credit Risk Analysis
- **Integration Focus**: Cross-domain intelligence through shared vendor relationships
- **Demonstration Goal**: Show AI-powered analysis with multi-step reasoning

## Demo Flow Standards
- **Story Structure**: 3-4 conversational turns per scenario
- **Turn Pattern**: User question → Agent analysis → Follow-up → Deeper insight
- **Timing Target**: ~15 minutes per scenario (not cumulative)
- **Multi-tool Usage**: Agents should demonstrate both search and analytical capabilities

## Agent Response Standards

### Citation Requirements
- Include source document ID/title with dates
- State currency, time period, and filters
- Provide data freshness indicators

### Risk Flagging Pattern
- ⚠️ **WARNING**: Approaching threshold
- 🚨 **BREACH**: Threshold exceeded
- Always include specific metric value and threshold

### Visualization Patterns
When user implies need for visual analysis:
- **Trends**: Suggest line chart
- **Comparisons**: Suggest bar chart
- **Composition**: Suggest stacked chart
- **Distribution**: Suggest histogram
- **KPI**: Inline value with severity color

## Tool Selection Logic
- **Quantitative questions** → Cortex Analyst on semantic views
- **Document questions** → Cortex Search services
- **Comprehensive analysis** → Both tools with synthesis
- **SQL visibility** → Only on explicit user request

## Risk Threshold Standards
Phase 1 uses EU/EBA-style thresholds (defined in config.py):
- Financial ratios with warning/breach levels
- Concentration limits for risk management
- Time-based monitoring requirements

## Document Taxonomy Patterns
### AML/KYC Documents
- Types: Onboarding, Adverse Media, PEP/Sanctions, Internal
- Risk Signals: Low, Medium, High
- Standard Attributes: id, title, content, entity_name, doc_type, date

### Credit Documents  
- Types: Business Plans, Financial Statements, Policy Documents
- Standard Attributes: id, title, content, applicant_name, doc_type, date

See patterns in respective implementation guides.
