**Demo Talking Points**:
- *"The AI connects quantitative metrics to qualitative insights from actual client interactions"*
- *"See how it identifies specific clients at risk with their last contact dates and planning status"*
- *"This level of insight would typically require hours of manual analysis across multiple systems"*

#### Step 3: Actionable Coaching Opportunities
**Demo Operator Says**: *"Instead of just identifying problems, let's get specific coaching recommendations with expected impact."*

**User Query**: `"Identify 10 quick wins for advisors below the median engagement to improve next quarter KPIs: who to contact, plan updates needed, and expected impact."`

**Expected Agent Response**:
- Prioritized list of specific client actions
- Contact recommendations with context (last interaction date, sentiment)

**Demo Talking Points**:
- *"Notice how it prioritizes actions based on likely impact - focusing on clients with outdated plans and positive sentiment"*
- *"The system references firm policy standards (6-month planning recency) for accountability"*
- *"These are actionable coaching points managers can immediately discuss with advisors"*

#### Step 4: Executive Summary for Leadership
**Demo Operator Says**: *"Finally, let's create an executive brief that summarizes everything for senior leadership."*

**User Query**: `"Create a one-page leadership brief summarizing advisor performance by quartiles with the top actions, owners, and timelines."`

**Expected Agent Response**:
- Executive summary with key findings
- Performance distribution by quartiles
- Top 3-5 priority actions with specific owners
- Timeline for implementation and follow-up
- Metrics to track progress

**Demo Talking Points**:
- *"Perfect for board presentations or executive team updates"*
