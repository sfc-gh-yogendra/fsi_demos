# WAM AI Demo - Unstructured Data Generation Rules

## General
- Store dynamic prompts in a Snowflake table (per corpus) with: `ID, PROMPT_TEXT, CONTEXT_KEYS (VARIANT)`.
- Use Snowpark DataFrames to apply `snowflake.cortex.complete` across rows.
- Parameterize model/temperature per corpus and scenario.

## Communications corpus
- Volume: ~50 communications per client over lifespan.
- Mix: 45% emails (25% threads), 30% phone transcripts (15–45 min), 25% online meetings (15–45 min).
- Sentiment distribution: 60% neutral, 25% positive, 15% negative; topic-aware.
- Grounding: reference at least one owned ticker on/near the date; inject minor noise (2–5%).

## Research corpus
- ~15 docs per golden ticker; spread over time windows.
- Include ESG (carbon neutrality) content in Phase 1.

## Regulatory corpus
- Curated subset focusing on rules referenced in scenarios.

## PDFs (Onboarding)
- AI-generate two PDFs per client (questionnaire, advisory agreement) and store in `@WAM_AI_DEMO.RAW.CLIENT_DOCS`.
- Later: support upload-to-stage processing flow.

## Determinism
- Use deterministic seeds by client/ticker/date to enable idempotent rebuilds.
