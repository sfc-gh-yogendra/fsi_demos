## Middle Office Operations

### Middle Office Copilot - NAV Calculation & Settlement Monitoring

#### Business Context Setup

**Persona**: Sarah, Middle Office Operations Manager at Snowcrest Asset Management  
**Business Challenge**: Middle office operations teams must monitor trade settlements, reconciliation breaks, NAV calculations, corporate actions, and cash management across multiple portfolios and custodians. Manual monitoring is time-consuming, error-prone, and fails to provide real-time exception alerts, risking operational failures, NAV errors, and settlement penalties.  
**Value Proposition**: AI-powered operations intelligence that provides real-time monitoring of all middle office processes, automated exception detection and root cause analysis, and intelligent remediation recommendations—transforming reactive operational fire-fighting into proactive exception management.

**Agent**: `middle_office_copilot`  
**Data Available**: 10 portfolios, 3 custodians, daily settlement activity, reconciliation data, NAV calculations, corporate actions, cash positions

#### Demo Flow

**Scene Setting**: It's 4:00 PM GMT and Sarah needs to review today's operational status across all middle office functions before the daily NAV calculation at 6:00 PM. She needs to quickly identify and resolve any settlement failures, reconciliation breaks, or issues that could impact tonight's NAV.

##### Step 1: Settlement Failure Monitoring
**User Input**: 
```
"Show me all failed settlements from the past 3 business days and help me understand what's causing them."
```

**Tools Used**:
- `middle_office_analyzer` (Cortex Analyst) - Query FACT_TRADE_SETTLEMENT for Status='Failed' in last 3 days from SAM_MIDDLE_OFFICE_VIEW

**Expected Response**:
- Table showing: Trade ID, Security, Counterparty, Settlement Amount, Days Old, Status, Failure Reason
- Severity flags: 🚨 FAILED (>T+2 days old - critical), ⚠️ PENDING (within T+2 window)
- Root cause analysis for each failure (SSI mismatch, insufficient securities, etc.)
- Specific remediation steps with ETAs and responsible parties
- Total failed settlement value and counterparty breakdown
- Data timestamp: "As of DD MMM YYYY HH:MM"

**Talking Points**:
- **Real-Time Operations Monitoring**: Instant visibility into settlement status across all counterparties
- **Automated Root Cause Analysis**: AI identifies specific failure reasons (SSI mismatch, counterparty issues)
- **Severity Classification**: Critical vs pending settlements based on age and regulatory requirements
- **Actionable Remediation**: Specific steps to resolve each failure with clear ownership

**Key Features Highlighted**: 
- **Operational Intelligence**: Real-time exception detection across all settlement activity
- **Root Cause Identification**: Automated analysis of failure reasons and remediation paths
- **Regulatory Awareness**: T+2 settlement monitoring with escalation for aged failures

##### Step 2: Reconciliation Break Investigation
**User Input**: 
```
"Summarize today's reconciliation breaks for all portfolios and flag any that are critical."
```

**Tools Used**:
- `middle_office_analyzer` (Cortex Analyst) - Query FACT_RECONCILIATION for Status='Open' breaks from SAM_MIDDLE_OFFICE_VIEW, ordered by Difference DESC

**Expected Response**:
- Overall reconciliation status: % matched, break counts by type and severity
- Table of critical breaks: Break Type, Portfolio, Security, Difference Amount, Status, Severity
- Severity classification:
  - 🚨 CRITICAL: Position breaks >£1M or >1% of NAV
  - ⚠️ HIGH: Cash breaks >£100K or >0.1% of NAV
  - Medium: Timing differences <£100K
- Root cause analysis for each critical break (corporate action, trade timing, system issue)
- Resolution timeline and actions required
- Impact on NAV calculation if unresolved

**Talking Points**:
- **Intelligent Break Prioritization**: AI automatically classifies breaks by severity and NAV impact
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Identifies whether breaks are due to corporate actions, timing, or system errors
- **NAV Impact Assessment**: Calculates potential NAV errors if breaks remain unresolved
- **Resolution Guidance**: Specific remediation steps with timeline to resolution

**Key Features Highlighted**: 
- **Break Classification**: Automated severity assessment based on amount and type
- **Corporate Action Detection**: Links breaks to unprocessed corporate actions
- **NAV Protection**: Identifies breaks that could cause NAV calculation errors

##### Step 3: NAV Calculation Status
**User Input**: 
```
"What's the status of today's NAV calculation across all funds? Are there any anomalies I need to investigate?"
```

**Tools Used**:
- `middle_office_analyzer` (Cortex Analyst) - Query FACT_NAV_CALCULATION for latest NAV by portfolio from SAM_MIDDLE_OFFICE_VIEW

**Expected Response**:
- NAV calculation summary: Completed funds, pending review, investigating
- Table by fund: Fund Name, NAV, Daily Change %, Status, Anomalies Detected
- Anomaly alerts:
  - ⚠️ ANOMALY DETECTED: >2% NAV change without corresponding market movement
  - Include expected vs actual NAV comparison
- Root cause investigation for flagged anomalies:
  - Unprocessed corporate actions affecting NAV
  - Reconciliation breaks impacting positions
  - Large redemptions or subscriptions
- Approval recommendations: Which NAVs are safe to approve vs which need investigation
- Timeline: Target submission time to fund accountants

**Talking Points**:
- **Automated Anomaly Detection**: AI identifies unusual NAV movements requiring investigation
- **Expected vs Actual Analysis**: Compares NAV change to market index movements
- **Root Cause Intelligence**: Links NAV anomalies to specific operational issues (breaks, corporate actions)
- **Approval Workflow**: Clear recommendations on which NAVs are ready vs need investigation

**Key Features Highlighted**: 
- **NAV Anomaly Detection**: Automated identification of unusual valuation movements
- **Cross-Functional Analysis**: Links NAV issues to reconciliation breaks and corporate actions
- **Approval Intelligence**: Risk-based recommendations for NAV approval

##### Step 4: Corporate Action Processing Status
**User Input**: 
```
"Show me all pending corporate actions for the next 5 business days and highlight any that require immediate processing."
```
