# SAM Demo - Agent Configuration Guide

Complete step-by-step guide for configuring Snowflake Intelligence agents with proper tool setup, instructions, and validation procedures. This guide is self-contained and provides all patterns needed to create new agents without external context.

## Overview

This guide provides the exact patterns and procedures for configuring agents in Snowflake Intelligence, including tool configurations, instruction templates, and testing approaches that work reliably with the SAM demo data model.

**Agent Types by Use Case:**
- **Multi-Tool Hybrid**: Portfolio Copilot (multiple Cortex Analyst + Search tools)
- **Search-Focused**: Research Copilot (document synthesis and analysis)
- **Analytics-Focused**: Quant Analyst (single/multiple Cortex Analyst tools)  
- **Compliance-Focused**: ESG Guardian (policy search + ESG analytics)

**Current Implementation Status** (see @project-setup.mdc for details):
- ✅ **portfolio_copilot**: Fully implemented and tested
- 🎯 **research_copilot, thematic_macro_advisor**: Ready for implementation (Phase 2)
- 🔄 **esg_guardian, compliance_advisor**: Requires new document types (Phase 3)
- 🔄 **sales_advisor, quant_analyst**: Requires enhancements (Phase 4)

## Step 1: Prerequisites and Preparation

### 1.1 Verify AI Components
Before configuring agents, verify all required AI components exist:

```python
def verify_ai_components_for_agent(session: Session, required_services: List[str]):
    """Verify semantic view and search services exist"""
    
    # Check semantic view exists
    try:
        session.sql("DESCRIBE SEMANTIC VIEW SAM_DEMO.AI.SAM_ANALYST_VIEW").collect()
        print("✅ Semantic view: SAM_ANALYST_VIEW")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"❌ Semantic view missing: {e}")
        return False
    
    # Check search services exist
    services = session.sql("SHOW CORTEX SEARCH SERVICES IN SAM_DEMO.AI").collect()
    existing_services = [service['name'] for service in services]
    
    for required_service in required_services:
        if required_service in existing_services:
            print(f"✅ Search service: {required_service}")
        else:
            print(f"❌ Missing search service: {required_service}")
            return False
    
    return True

# Example usage for Portfolio Copilot:
required_services = ['SAM_BROKER_RESEARCH', 'SAM_EARNINGS_TRANSCRIPTS', 'SAM_PRESS_RELEASES']
verify_ai_components_for_agent(session, required_services)
```

### 1.2 Validate Data Readiness
Ensure data is ready for agent testing:

```python
def validate_agent_data_readiness(session: Session):
    """Validate data quality and completeness for agents"""
    
    # Check portfolio data
    portfolios = session.sql("SELECT PORTFOLIONAME FROM SAM_DEMO.CURATED.DIM_PORTFOLIO").collect()
    print(f"✅ Available portfolios: {len(portfolios)}")
    
    # Check holdings data
    holdings_count = session.sql("""
        SELECT COUNT(*) as count 
        FROM SAM_DEMO.CURATED.FACT_POSITION_DAILY_ABOR 
        WHERE HoldingDate = (SELECT MAX(HoldingDate) FROM SAM_DEMO.CURATED.FACT_POSITION_DAILY_ABOR)
    """).collect()[0]['COUNT']
    print(f"✅ Current holdings: {holdings_count} positions")
    
    # Check document corpus
    for corpus in ['BROKER_RESEARCH_CORPUS', 'EARNINGS_TRANSCRIPTS_CORPUS', 'PRESS_RELEASES_CORPUS']:
        doc_count = session.sql(f"SELECT COUNT(*) as count FROM SAM_DEMO.CURATED.{corpus}").collect()[0]['COUNT']
        print(f"✅ {corpus}: {doc_count} documents")
    
    return True
```

6. For charts: Include clear titles describing what is shown
7. If information unavailable: State clearly and suggest alternatives
8. Focus on actionable insights and {domain-specific} implications
9. Use UK English spelling and terminology
```

## Step 4: Agent Testing and Validation

### 4.1 Systematic Testing Approach
**Testing Strategy:**
1. **Component Testing**: Verify each tool works independently
2. **Integration Testing**: Test tool combinations for mixed queries
3. **Business Scenario Testing**: Test with actual demo conversation flows
4. **Edge Case Testing**: Test with missing data, complex queries, error conditions

### 4.2 Component Testing Pattern
```python
def test_agent_components(session: Session, agent_name: str, tools: List[str]):
    """Test each agent tool independently based on tool type"""
    
    # Test Cortex Analyst tools (if any)
    analyst_tools = [tool for tool in tools if not tool.startswith('search_')]
    for analyst_tool in analyst_tools:
        try:
            # Test with basic semantic view query
            result = session.sql("""
                SELECT * FROM SEMANTIC_VIEW(
                    SAM_DEMO.AI.SAM_ANALYST_VIEW
                    METRICS TOTAL_MARKET_VALUE
                    DIMENSIONS PORTFOLIONAME
                ) LIMIT 5
            """).collect()
            print(f"✅ Cortex Analyst tool test passed: {analyst_tool} ({len(result)} results)")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"❌ Cortex Analyst tool test failed for {analyst_tool}: {e}")
    
    # Test Cortex Search tools (if any)
    search_tools = [tool for tool in tools if tool.startswith('search_')]
    for search_tool in search_tools:
        service_name = f"SAM_{search_tool.replace('search_', '').upper()}"
        try:
            result = session.sql(f"""
                SELECT SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.SEARCH_PREVIEW(
                    'SAM_DEMO.AI.{service_name}',
                    '{{"query": "test", "limit": 1}}'
                )
            """).collect()
            print(f"✅ Cortex Search tool test passed: {search_tool}")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"❌ Cortex Search tool test failed for {search_tool}: {e}")
    
    # Validate agent has at least one working tool
    if not analyst_tools and not search_tools:
        print(f"❌ Agent {agent_name} has no valid tools configured")
        return False
    
    return True
```

### 4.3 Business Scenario Testing
Test with queries appropriate for your agent's tool configuration:

**Testing Strategy by Agent Type:**

**Multi-Tool Agents (Multiple Analysts + Search):**
- Test quantitative queries that use different Cortex Analyst tools
- Test qualitative queries that use Cortex Search tools
- Test mixed queries that require both analyst and search tools
- Test queries that span multiple analytical domains
- Verify tool selection logic works correctly for different domains

**Multiple Cortex Analyst Agents:**
- Test queries appropriate for each analyst tool domain
- Test domain-specific analytical scenarios
- Test queries that require multiple analyst perspectives
- Test chart and visualization generation across tools
- Verify all business metrics are accessible in appropriate tools

**Single Cortex Analyst Agents:**
- Test data analysis and calculation queries for the specific domain
- Test chart and visualization generation
- Test complex analytical scenarios within the domain
- Verify all relevant business metrics are accessible

**Cortex Search Only Agents:**
- Test document search across all configured document types
- Test synthesis of information from multiple sources
- Test citation and source attribution
- Verify search relevance and coverage

**Example Test Query Patterns:**
```python
# Portfolio analytics (Cortex Analyst)
"What are my top 10 holdings in the SAM Global Thematic Growth fund?"
"Show me sector allocation across all portfolios"
"Calculate concentration warnings above 6.5%"

# Document research (Cortex Search)  
"What is the latest research on Apple and Microsoft?"
"Find ESG controversies in my portfolio companies"
"What does our policy say about environmental violations?"

# Mixed queries (Multi-tool agents)
"Show me top holdings and their latest research ratings"
"Analyze sector exposure and find supporting research themes"
```

### 4.4 Validation Checklist
- [ ] All required AI components exist (semantic views and/or search services)
- [ ] Data quality validated (appropriate for agent's tool types)
- [ ] Each configured tool works independently
- [ ] Tool combinations work correctly (for multi-tool agents)
- [ ] Business scenario queries return expected results
- [ ] Error handling works appropriately
- [ ] Performance is acceptable for demo use
- [ ] Agent responds appropriately when tools have no data

## Step 5: Troubleshooting

For comprehensive troubleshooting of agent setup, query issues, performance problems, and live demo testing issues, see @troubleshooting.mdc.

**Quick Reference for Common Issues:**
- **Agent not responding**: Verify AI components exist (semantic views, search services)
- **Tool not found**: Check service names and column configurations match exactly
- **No search results**: Verify document corpus exists and has content
- **Portfolio not found**: Use full names with "SAM" prefix in test queries
- **Performance issues**: Check warehouse size and optimize query patterns

**Critical Demo Testing Queries:**
```
"What are my top 10 holdings in the SAM Global Thematic Growth fund?"
"What is the latest research on Apple, Microsoft, and NVIDIA?"
"Show me technology sector allocation across all portfolios"
```

## Step 6: Agent Archetypes and Patterns

### 6.1 Agent Archetypes

**Multi-Domain Analytics Agents (Multiple Cortex Analysts):**
- **Use Cases**: Comprehensive analysis across different data domains (portfolio + risk + performance)
- **Tool Configuration**: Multiple Cortex Analyst tools with different semantic views
- **Planning Focus**: Domain-specific tool selection, cross-domain synthesis
- **Examples**: Chief investment officer agent, comprehensive portfolio manager, multi-domain analyst

**Single-Domain Analytics Agents (Single Cortex Analyst):**
- **Use Cases**: Focused analysis within specific domain (portfolio analysis, risk monitoring, performance attribution)
- **Tool Configuration**: Single Cortex Analyst tool with domain-specific semantic view
- **Planning Focus**: Deep analytical capabilities within domain, visualization generation
- **Examples**: Portfolio analyzer, risk monitor, performance tracker, ESG scorer

**Research-Focused Agents (Cortex Search Only):**
- **Use Cases**: Document synthesis, policy research, literature review, compliance checking
- **Tool Configuration**: Multiple Cortex Search tools for different document types
- **Planning Focus**: Document search, content synthesis, citation management
- **Examples**: Policy researcher, document librarian, compliance checker, ESG researcher

**Hybrid Agents (Multiple Analysts + Search):**
- **Use Cases**: Investment decisions, comprehensive analysis, client advisory, multi-domain insights
- **Tool Configuration**: Multiple Cortex Analyst tools + multiple Cortex Search tools
- **Planning Focus**: Complex tool selection logic, data-to-document workflows, cross-domain synthesis
- **Examples**: Portfolio copilot, investment advisor, ESG guardian, chief risk officer agent

### 6.2 Configuration Best Practices

**Tool Ordering:**
- List most frequently used tools first
- Group similar tools together (all search tools together)
- Consider tool execution time in ordering

**Description Clarity:**
- Clearly define when to use each tool
- Avoid overlapping use cases between tools
- Include specific examples of appropriate queries

**Planning Instructions:**
- Provide explicit tool selection logic
- Handle edge cases (no data, multiple tools applicable)
- Include synthesis guidance for multi-tool responses
- Include specific flagging and threshold logic for the agent to apply

**CRITICAL PRINCIPLE: Flagging Logic Placement**
- **Agent Instructions**: All flagging, thresholds, and highlighting behaviors
- **Cortex Analyst**: Only data calculations and SQL generation
- **Never**: Put business rule flagging in semantic view custom instructions
