## Flagging and Response Behavior Documentation

### When to Document Expected Flagging
Always document specific flagging behaviors in Expected Response sections:

**Concentration Warnings:**
```markdown
**Expected Response**:
- Table showing: Ticker, Company Name, Weight %, Market Value USD
- Flag any positions >6.5% with "⚠️ CONCENTRATION WARNING"
- Include exact percentage and recommend monitoring or reduction
- Total exposure percentage of flagged positions
```

**Compliance Breaches:**
```markdown
**Expected Response**:
- List of breaches by portfolio and rule type
- Flag positions >7% with "🚨 BREACH" and >6.5% with "⚠️ WARNING"
- Severity assessment with exact percentages
- Affected positions with amounts and percentages
```

**ESG Severity Levels:**
```markdown
**Expected Response**:
- List of flagged controversies with severity levels (High/Medium/Low)
- Affected portfolio companies and exposure amounts
- Source citations with NGO names and publication dates
```

### Alignment with Agent Instructions
Ensure all expected flagging behaviors are reflected in corresponding agent instructions:
- Portfolio agents: Concentration warning flagging (6.5%)
- Compliance agents: Breach (7%) and warning (6.5%) flagging
- ESG agents: Severity level classification (High/Medium/Low)
- Sales agents: Professional report formatting requirements
- Quant agents: Statistical significance and confidence intervals

## Quality Standards

### Content Quality Requirements
- **Realistic Language**: Use authentic business terminology and scenarios
- **Professional Tone**: Maintain executive-level communication standards
- **Consistent Formatting**: Follow template structure exactly
- **UK English**: Use British spelling and financial terminology throughout
- **Business Focus**: Emphasize business value over technical features

### Technical Accuracy Requirements
- **Agent Alignment**: Ensure expected responses match agent capabilities
- **Data Consistency**: Use realistic portfolio names and company examples
- **Feature Accuracy**: Only reference implemented Snowflake capabilities
- **Integration Logic**: Ensure multi-step flows make business sense

### Presentation Requirements
- **Demo Flow Logic**: Each step should build naturally to the next
- **Time Management**: 4-step flows should take 10-15 minutes total
- **Audience Engagement**: Include impressive moments and "wow" factors
- **Business Relevance**: All scenarios should solve real business problems

## Examples of Good vs Bad Documentation

### ✅ Good Example - Business Challenge
```markdown
**Business Challenge**: Portfolio managers need instant access to portfolio analytics, holdings information, and supporting research to make informed investment decisions. Traditional systems require multiple tools, manual data gathering, and time-consuming analysis that delays critical investment decisions.
```

### ❌ Bad Example - Business Challenge
```markdown
**Business Challenge**: Portfolio managers need data.
```

### ✅ Good Example - User Input
```markdown
**User Input**: 
```
"What are my top 10 holdings by market value in the SAM Technology & Infrastructure portfolio?"
```
```

### ❌ Bad Example - User Input
```markdown
**User Input**: 
```
"SELECT * FROM holdings WHERE portfolio = 'tech'"
```
```

### ✅ Good Example - Expected Response
```markdown
**Expected Response**:
- Table showing: Ticker, Company Name, Weight %, Market Value USD
- Flag any positions >6.5% with "⚠️ CONCENTRATION WARNING"
- Include exact percentage and recommend monitoring or reduction
- Total exposure percentage of top 10
```

### ❌ Bad Example - Expected Response
```markdown
**Expected Response**:
- Show some data
```

## Demo Coherence Requirements

### Critical Challenge: Multi-Step Flow Dependencies
Demo scenarios with multiple steps must ensure logical progression where each step builds on previous results. Random data generation can break coherence when Step 2 references entities not mentioned in Step 1.

### Solution Approach: Dual Strategy
1. **Enhanced Data Generation**: Ensure key demo companies get theme-specific content
2. **Refined Query Design**: Make queries more specific to increase hit probability

### Example: Research Copilot Demo Fix
**Problem**: 
- Step 1: "What is the latest research saying about technology sector opportunities?"
- Step 2: "Based on those technology opportunities, give me a detailed analysis of Microsoft's recent performance..."
- **Issue**: Step 1 didn't return Microsoft research, breaking Step 2 flow

**Solution Applied**:
- **Data Enhancement**: Modified broker research generation to ensure Microsoft gets "technology sector opportunities" themed content
- **Query Refinement**: Changed Step 1 to "What is the latest research saying about AI and cloud computing opportunities in technology companies?"
- **Result**: Guaranteed Microsoft appears in Step 1 for coherent Step 2 follow-up

### Demo Coherence Best Practices
1. **Map Dependencies**: Identify which entities must appear in which steps
2. **Specific Queries**: Use targeted queries rather than broad themes
3. **Expected Alignment**: Ensure expected responses match likely data generation outcomes
4. **Validation Testing**: Test complete flows after data regeneration
5. **Fallback Strategies**: Design queries that work even with partial data coverage

### Query Design Patterns
```markdown
# ✅ Good - Specific and targeted
"What is the latest research saying about AI and cloud computing opportunities in technology companies?"

# ❌ Risky - Too broad, unpredictable results  
"What is the latest research saying about technology sector opportunities?"

# ✅ Good - References specific context
"Based on those AI and cloud opportunities, give me a detailed analysis of Microsoft's recent performance..."

# ❌ Bad - Assumes specific company mentioned
"Based on those technology opportunities, give me a detailed analysis of Apple's recent performance..."
```

## Status Management Standards

### Implementation Status Guidelines

**Status Centralization:**
- All implementation status tracking occurs ONLY in "Available Scenarios by Role" section
- Status appears at scenario level: `✅ **IMPLEMENTED**` or `❌ **NOT IMPLEMENTED**`
- Agent names and scenario headers throughout document contain NO status indicators
- Clean, professional headers maintain focus on content rather than implementation state

**Status Placement Rules:**
```markdown
# ✅ CORRECT - Status in overview only (at document top)
## Available Scenarios by Role

### Portfolio Manager
**Agent: Portfolio Copilot**
- Portfolio Insights & Benchmarking ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**

---

## Portfolio Manager

### Portfolio Copilot - Portfolio Insights & Benchmarking
{Clean header with no status - Level 3 heading}

#### Business Context Setup
{Level 4 heading}

#### Demo Flow
{Level 4 heading}

##### Step 1: Top Holdings Overview
{Level 5 heading}

# ❌ WRONG - Status in scenario headers
### Portfolio Copilot - Portfolio Insights & Benchmarking ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**
```

**Document Organization Benefits:**
- **Professional Presentation**: Clean headers suitable for client-facing documentation
- **Centralized Tracking**: Implementation status visible in one overview location
- **Content Focus**: Scenario content emphasizes business value rather than technical status
- **Executive Appeal**: Professional structure appropriate for senior business audiences

### Content vs. Implementation Separation

**Implementation Overview** (with status):
- Located at document beginning for quick reference
- Shows current state of demo capabilities
- Used for project planning and priority setting
- Updated as scenarios are implemented

**Scenario Content** (clean, no status):
- Professional business narratives and demonstration flows
- Focus on business value and technical capabilities
- Suitable for client presentations and executive briefings
- Timeless content that doesn't require status updates
