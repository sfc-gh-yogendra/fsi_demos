## 1. Policy Statement

Snowcrest Asset Management ("SAM" or "the Firm") is committed to integrating environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors into our investment processes. We believe that companies demonstrating strong ESG practices are better positioned for sustainable long-term value creation and present more favourable risk-adjusted return profiles.

This Sustainable Investment Policy establishes our approach to ESG integration, exclusion criteria, active ownership activities, and reporting requirements. The policy applies to all discretionary investment strategies managed by the Firm, with specific implementation varying by strategy mandate and client requirements.

## 2. Investment Approach and ESG Integration

**Fundamental Analysis Enhancement**: ESG factors are incorporated into our fundamental company research and investment analysis. Material ESG risks and opportunities are identified, assessed, and reflected in investment decisions alongside traditional financial metrics. We view ESG analysis as complementary to financial analysis, providing additional insights into business quality, competitive positioning, and risk management effectiveness.

**Materiality Assessment**: ESG factors are evaluated based on their materiality to long-term investment performance. Materiality varies by sector, with different ESG issues carrying greater significance in different industries. Our research analysts identify sector-specific material ESG factors and incorporate them systematically into company valuations and investment recommendations.

**Research Process**: Company research includes evaluation of environmental management practices, social capital and stakeholder relationships, and corporate governance structures. We utilize third-party ESG research providers to supplement our proprietary analysis, whilst maintaining independence in investment decision-making. ESG assessments are documented in internal research reports and investment committee memoranda.

## 3. Exclusion Criteria

**Controversial Weapons**: The Firm excludes companies involved in the production, development, or sale of controversial weapons including cluster munitions, anti-personnel landmines, biological weapons, and chemical weapons. This exclusion applies firm-wide across all investment strategies.

**High-Severity ESG Controversies**: Companies subject to high-severity ESG controversies as defined by our ESG research framework trigger automatic review. High-severity controversies include severe environmental violations, significant human rights abuses, major governance failures, or criminal investigations related to corporate conduct. Investment Committee approval is required to maintain positions in companies with ongoing high-severity controversies.

**ESG-Labelled Portfolio Specific Exclusions**: Portfolios with explicit ESG labels or sustainability mandates apply additional exclusion criteria:
- Thermal coal extraction (>5% of revenue)
- Oil sands extraction (>5% of revenue)
- Tobacco production
- Civilian firearms manufacturing
- Gambling operations (>10% of revenue)
- Adult entertainment production

**Sector-Specific Standards**: Certain sectors warrant enhanced scrutiny. Fossil fuel companies must demonstrate credible transition strategies aligned with Paris Agreement objectives. Mining companies require strong environmental management systems and community engagement practices. Pharmaceutical companies must maintain ethical pricing and access policies.

## 4. ESG Rating Requirements

**ESG-Labelled Portfolios**: Investment strategies marketed with explicit ESG or sustainability labels must maintain minimum portfolio ESG ratings:
- Minimum portfolio-weighted average ESG rating of BBB (on AAA to CCC scale)
- Maximum 10% of portfolio in securities rated below BBB
- No holdings permitted in securities rated CCC or below

**Applicable Strategies**: ESG rating requirements apply to:
- SAM ESG Leaders Global Equity
- SAM Renewable & Climate Solutions
- SAM Sustainable Global Equity
- Any strategy with "ESG", "Sustainable", or "Responsible" in the name

**Monitoring and Compliance**: Portfolio ESG ratings are monitored monthly. Breaches of minimum rating requirements trigger automatic review and remediation within 90 days. Rating downgrades of individual holdings are assessed for continued suitability in ESG-labelled portfolios.

---

## 5. Active Ownership and Engagement

**Engagement Strategy**: SAM engages with portfolio companies on material ESG issues as part of our fiduciary duty and active ownership responsibilities. Engagement topics are prioritized based on materiality, potential for positive change, and portfolio exposure.

**Engagement Approach**: Engagements typically involve direct dialogue with company management, submission of shareholder proposals on ESG matters, and collaboration with other institutional investors through collective engagement initiatives. We document all engagement activities and track management commitments over time.

**Proxy Voting**: SAM exercises voting rights on ESG-related shareholder proposals based on case-by-case analysis of potential impact on long-term shareholder value. We generally support proposals that enhance transparency, strengthen board accountability, or address material ESG risks. Our proxy voting guidelines are available on our website.

**Escalation Procedures**: When engagement does not produce satisfactory outcomes, we may escalate through additional mechanisms including voting against director elections, submitting shareholder proposals, or ultimately divesting positions if ESG concerns remain unaddressed and materially impact investment thesis.

---

## 6. Reporting and Disclosure

**Portfolio ESG Reporting**: Clients receive portfolio ESG metrics including weighted average ESG rating, carbon footprint analysis, and notable ESG events or controversies affecting portfolio holdings. Reporting frequency varies by client requirements, typically quarterly or annually.

**Public Disclosure**: SAM publishes an annual Responsible Investment Report detailing our ESG integration practices, engagement activities, proxy voting record, and portfolio sustainability metrics. This report provides transparency to clients and stakeholders regarding our sustainable investment approach.

**Regulatory Compliance**: Our sustainable investment practices and disclosures comply with applicable regulations including EU Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR), where relevant, and other jurisdictional requirements.

## 7. Governance and Policy Review

**ESG Committee**: The Firm's ESG Committee, comprising senior investment professionals and the Head of ESG Research, oversees implementation of this policy. The Committee meets quarterly to review ESG integration practices, engagement activities, and policy effectiveness.

**Annual Review**: This Sustainable Investment Policy is reviewed annually by the ESG Committee and Investment Committee, with material changes subject to Board approval. Reviews assess policy effectiveness, industry best practice developments, regulatory changes, and stakeholder feedback.

**Training and Implementation**: All investment professionals receive training on ESG integration, this policy's requirements, and sector-specific ESG considerations. Compliance with this policy is monitored by our Compliance function with quarterly reporting to senior management.
