## Procedure Steps

### Step 1: Data Collection and Validation (T+0 to T+2 hours)

1. **Import Custodian Data**
   - Download position files from BNY Mellon Nexen
   - Import into NAV system (SimCorp Dimension)
   - Verify record counts match expected

2. **Import Pricing Data**
   - Load prices from Bloomberg
   - Import FX rates from WM/Reuters
   - Flag securities without prices

3. **Reconcile Positions**
   - Match custodian positions to internal records
   - Investigate breaks >100 shares or 0.01%
   - Document reconciliation items

4. **Validate Cash Balances**
   - Reconcile cash by currency
   - Verify pending settlements
   - Confirm income receipts

**Quality Checks:**
- Position count within expected range
- Total market value within 5% of prior day
- No missing prices for material holdings (>1%)
- Cash balances reconciled

**Output:** Reconciliation report, exception list

### Step 2: NAV Calculation (T+2 to T+3 hours)

1. **Calculate Gross Asset Value (GAV)**
   ```
   GAV = (Securities Market Value) + (Cash) + (Receivables) - (Payables)
   ```

2. **Calculate Accrued Expenses**
   - Daily management fee accrual = (AUM × Annual Fee Rate) / 365
   - Performance fee accrual (if applicable)
   - Audit and custody fee accruals

3. **Calculate Net Asset Value (NAV)**
   ```
   NAV = GAV - Accrued Expenses - Other Liabilities
   ```

4. **Calculate NAV per Share**
   ```
   NAV per Share = NAV / Shares Outstanding
   ```

5. **Calculate Returns**
   - Daily return = (NAV per Share today / NAV per Share yesterday) - 1
   - MTD return
   - YTD return

**Validation Checks:**
- NAV variance vs prior day within expected range
- Expense accruals calculated correctly
- Share count matches registry
- Returns calculation verified

### Step 3: Anomaly Detection and Investigation (T+2.5 to T+3 hours)

**Anomaly Thresholds:**
- NAV per share change >2% (typical: 2%)
- Total return outside 1.5× market index return
- Unexplained cash movement >£100,000
- Position break >£50,000

**Investigation Process:**
1. Identify anomaly type (price, position, cash, expense)
2. Check for corporate actions on anomaly date
3. Review large trades or redemptions
4. Verify pricing sources for material holdings
5. Confirm calculation formulas
6. Document findings

**Resolution:**
- If explainable: Document explanation, proceed to approval
- If data error: Correct data, recalculate NAV
- If pricing issue: Obtain fair value price, recalculate
- If unexplainable: Escalate to NAV Manager, do not publish

### Step 4: NAV Review and Approval (T+3 to T+3.5 hours)

1. **NAV Analyst Review**
   - Verify all checks completed
   - Confirm anomalies investigated
   - Prepare NAV approval memo

2. **NAV Manager Approval**

   - Check variance explanations
   - Verify material items
   - Approve or reject NAV

**Approval Criteria:**
- All reconciliation breaks resolved or documented
- Anomalies investigated and explained
- Pricing validated for material holdings
- Returns reasonable vs market and peers

### Step 5: NAV Publication (T+3.5 to T+4 hours)
