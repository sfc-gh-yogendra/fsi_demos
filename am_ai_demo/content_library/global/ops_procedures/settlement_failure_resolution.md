- Update tracking system

### Middle Office Manager
- Review all aging failures (>T+5)

### Risk Management

## Procedure Steps

### Step 1: Detection and Logging (Daily, 09:00)
**Timeframe:** Within 1 hour of market open

1. Access custodian settlement reports
   - Log into BNY Mellon Nexen
   - Navigate to Settlement Status dashboard
   - Filter for "Failed" and "Pending" statuses

2. Export failure data
   - Download CSV file of all failures
   - Import into internal tracking system (SmartStream TLM Reconciliation)
   - Generate failure report

3. Categorize failures
   - By asset class (Equity, FI, FX)
   - By age (T+1, T+2, T+3, T+4, T+5+)
   - By portfolio
   - By counterparty

**Output:** Daily Settlement Failure Report

### Step 2: Initial Investigation (Same Day, Before 12:00)

1. Review trade details
   - Trade date and settlement date
   - Counterparty information
   - Settlement instructions used
   - Expected settlement method (DVP, FOP, PvP)

2. Contact custodian
   - Call settlement desk: custody.operations@bnymellon.com
   - Request failure reason code
   - Obtain expected resolution timeframe
   - Document conversation in tracking system

3. Common failure reasons and initial actions:
   - **Insufficient Securities:** Contact selling counterparty
   - **Payment Pending:** Verify cash position and payment instruction
   - **SSI Mismatch:** Review and correct settlement instructions
   - **System Error:** Contact custodian IT desk
   - **Counterparty Delay:** Escalate to counterparty operations

**Output:** Investigation notes in tracking system

### Step 3: Resolution Actions (Same Day)

#### For SSI Mismatches
1. Retrieve correct SSI from master file
2. Verify SSI with counterparty operations
3. Submit corrected SSI to custodian
4. Request settlement retry
5. Confirm new settlement date

#### For Insufficient Securities
1. Contact counterparty operations
2. Determine if securities available next day
3. If unavailable, discuss alternative resolution:
   - Partial settlement
   - Trade cancellation
   - Market purchase (buy-in)
4. Obtain written confirmation of resolution plan

#### For Payment Issues
1. Verify cash availability in settlement currency
2. Check payment instruction status
3. Contact treasury desk if cash shortfall
4. Arrange FX if currency conversion needed
5. Resubmit payment instruction

### Step 4: Monitoring and Follow-up (Daily Until Resolved)

1. Check status of pending resolutions
2. Contact counterparty if no progress
3. Update tracking system with status
4. Escalate if failure aging beyond T+3

**Escalation Triggers:**
- Any failure beyond T+5
- Repeated failures with same counterparty (3+ in month)
- Material failures (>£5M per trade)
- Pattern of failures in specific security or market

### Step 5: Aging Failure Escalation (T+5 and Beyond)

1. Prepare escalation memo including:
   - Trade details and failure reason
   - Investigation summary
   - Resolution attempts to date
   - Recommended action (buy-in, claim, cancellation)
   - Financial impact

2. Submit to Middle Office Manager for review

3. If approved, proceed with resolution:
   - **Buy-in:** Execute market purchase, claim difference from counterparty
   - **Cancellation:** Cancel original trade, adjust portfolio positions
   - **Legal claim:** Refer to Legal and Compliance

### Step 6: Post-Resolution Actions

1. Update tracking system with final resolution
2. Calculate and document financial impact
3. If loss occurred:
   - Submit claim to counterparty
   - Notify Finance for P&L adjustment
   - Escalate to Legal if counterparty refuses claim

4. Root cause analysis
   - Identify systemic issues
   - Document lessons learned
   - Recommend process improvements
