**Incident Tracking**: Operational errors, near-misses, and risk events analyzed for root causes and systemic issues.

**External Intelligence**: Regulatory guidance, industry developments, cyber threat intelligence, and market risk indicators.

### Risk Assessment and Prioritization

**Risk Impact Assessment**: Potential severity measured in financial loss, regulatory consequence, reputational damage, or operational disruption.

**Probability Assessment**: Likelihood evaluated based on historical frequency, control effectiveness, and risk environment.

**Risk Rating Matrix**: Combining impact and probability yields risk rating (High/Medium/Low) informing prioritization and mitigation strategies.
