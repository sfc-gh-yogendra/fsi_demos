## Market Outlook and Risk Assessment

**Sentiment Indicators**:
- **VIX (Volatility Index)**: {{VIX_LEVEL}} (+{{VIX_CHANGE}}% today, elevated uncertainty)
- **Put/Call Ratio**: {{PUT_CALL_RATIO}} (above 1.0 indicates defensive positioning)
- **Fear & Greed Index**: {{FEAR_GREED}} (Fear territory)

**Technical Levels**:
- S&P 500 Support/Resistance: {{SP500_SUPPORT}} / {{SP500_RESISTANCE}}
- S&P 500 closed below 50-day moving average, technically concerning
- Market breadth weak with declining issues outnumbering advancers 3:1

**Risk Assessment**: Elevated uncertainty and risk-off sentiment suggest potential for continued volatility in near term. Defensive positioning appropriate until catalysts emerge for renewed risk appetite. Government bonds and quality defensive equities may continue outperforming as investors prioritize capital preservation over growth.

Key risks to monitor include potential policy responses to current challenges, economic data trajectory, and corporate earnings resilience. Sustained risk-off conditions typically resolve through either fundamental improvement or valuation becoming sufficiently attractive to entice buyers back into risk assets.
