# Snowcrest Asset Management — Risk Management Philosophy

**Document Type**: Investment Philosophy  
**Topic**: Risk Management Framework and Approach  
**Effective Date**: January 2024  
**Classification**: Public

## Our Risk Framework

At Snowcrest Asset Management, we view risk management as inseparable from investment management. Effective risk management enables us to pursue attractive return opportunities whilst protecting client capital and maintaining fiduciary responsibilities. Our risk framework integrates into all aspects of our investment process, from portfolio construction to ongoing monitoring and governance.

We define investment risk broadly, encompassing not only volatility and drawdown potential but also liquidity risk, concentration risk, counterparty risk, operational risk, and reputational risk. This comprehensive perspective ensures we identify and manage diverse risk sources systematically.

## Risk Types and Management Approach

### Market Risk

**Systematic Risk**: We accept market risk as inherent to generating equity and credit returns. Portfolio construction considers appropriate market exposure levels given strategy mandates and client risk tolerance. We utilize diversification across securities, sectors, and geographies to manage specific risk whilst maintaining exposure to market beta where appropriate for return objectives.

**Specific Risk**: Security-specific risk is managed through fundamental research, position sizing, and diversification. Concentration limits prevent any single security from creating excessive portfolio risk. Research quality and ongoing monitoring mitigate company-specific risk factors.

**Interest Rate Risk**: Fixed income portfolios manage duration relative to benchmarks and client guidelines. We consider interest rate sensitivity in asset allocation decisions and employ duration management techniques to align portfolios with rate outlook whilst respecting risk constraints.

### Credit Risk

**Issuer Default Risk**: Fixed income portfolios maintain minimum credit quality standards, typically requiring 75%+ investment grade holdings. We conduct proprietary credit analysis complementing external ratings, focusing on cash flow sustainability, leverage trends, and covenant protections.

**Counterparty Risk**: We transact with financially sound counterparties and monitor counterparty exposure limits. Custody arrangements with reputable institutions protect client assets. Derivative usage, when permitted, involves exchange-traded instruments or creditworthy counterparties.

### Liquidity Risk

**Asset Liquidity**: We maintain portfolio liquidity appropriate for strategy redemption terms and market conditions. Position sizes consider average daily trading volumes. Concentration in illiquid securities is avoided unless explicitly permitted by mandate with appropriate liquidity premiums.

**Funding Liquidity**: Cash positions and liquid securities ensure adequate capacity for rebalancing, client redemptions, and opportunistic investments. Stress testing evaluates portfolio liquidity under adverse scenarios.

### Operational Risk

**Process and Systems**: Robust operational procedures, automated controls, and system redundancy mitigate operational failures. Business continuity planning ensures service continuation during disruptions. Regular process reviews and technology investments strengthen operational resilience.

**Human Capital**: Staff training, knowledge documentation, and succession planning reduce key person dependencies. Compliance procedures and supervisory review provide oversight of trading, operations, and client service activities.

## Risk Management Process

### Risk Identification

We employ multiple mechanisms to identify risks including:
- Pre-investment due diligence and research analysis
- Position-level risk monitoring (concentration, liquidity, correlations)
- Portfolio-level risk analytics (volatility, tracking error, VaR, stress testing)
- Market and macroeconomic risk assessment
- Regulatory and compliance risk scanning
- Operational risk and control self-assessments

### Risk Measurement

**Quantitative Metrics**: We employ standard risk metrics including volatility, tracking error, value-at-risk, maximum drawdown, and correlation analysis. These metrics provide objective risk assessment and support comparison across strategies and time periods.

**Qualitative Assessment**: Risk assessment incorporates qualitative factors including business model sustainability, competitive dynamics, management quality, and ESG considerations. Qualitative analysis complements quantitative metrics for comprehensive risk understanding.

**Stress Testing and Scenario Analysis**: Regular stress testing evaluates portfolio behavior under adverse scenarios including market crashes, interest rate shocks, credit events, and liquidity crises. Scenario analysis informs position sizing and risk mitigation strategies.

### Risk Management and Mitigation

**Position Limits**: Concentration limits prevent excessive single-security or issuer risk. Hard limits at 7% with early warning thresholds at 6.5% ensure disciplined position sizing. Sector and geographic limits provide diversification across risk factors.

**Quality Standards**: Minimum credit quality requirements, market capitalization thresholds, and liquidity standards ensure portfolios comprise appropriate securities for strategy mandates.

**Hedging**: When permitted by strategy guidelines, we may employ hedging strategies to manage specific risks including currency exposure, interest rate sensitivity, or tail risk protection.

**Diversification**: Appropriate diversification across securities, sectors, geographies, and risk factors reduces portfolio-specific risk whilst maintaining exposure to desired return drivers.

### Risk Monitoring and Reporting

**Daily Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring of position sizes, concentration levels, and compliance with investment guidelines. Automated alerts for positions approaching limits or unusual market movements.

**Weekly Reporting**: Risk dashboard for Chief Investment Officer covering portfolio risk metrics, notable position changes, and emerging risks requiring attention.

**Monthly Reporting**: Comprehensive risk reports to Investment Committee including risk metrics, stress test results, attribution analysis, and risk budget utilization.

**Quarterly Reporting**: Client reporting includes relevant risk metrics, concentration analysis, and risk management commentary.

## Integration with Investment Process

Risk management is embedded throughout our investment process rather than treated as separate function:

**Research and Analysis**: Company research identifies and evaluates material risks. Investment recommendations include explicit risk assessment.

**Portfolio Construction**: Risk budgeting allocates risk capacity to highest-conviction ideas. Position sizing reflects conviction levels and risk-reward assessment.

**Trading and Implementation**: Trade execution considers market impact, timing risk, and implementation costs. Pre-trade compliance checks ensure guideline adherence.

**Ongoing Monitoring**: Continuous position monitoring, regular portfolio review, and dynamic risk assessment support timely position adjustments.

**Performance Attribution**: Attribution analysis decomposing returns into risk factor exposures informs future positioning decisions.

---

## Governance and Oversight

**Risk Committee**: Quarterly meetings review risk management effectiveness, emerging risks, and policy enhancements. Committee comprises senior investment professionals and reports to firm leadership.

**Investment Committee**: Reviews portfolio risk profiles, concentration levels, and risk-adjusted performance. Approves positions exceeding standard concentration limits.

**Independent Oversight**: Compliance function provides independent monitoring of investment guidelines, trading practices, and risk limits. Regular compliance reporting to senior management and board.

**Board Review**: Annual risk framework review with board of directors assesses risk management effectiveness and approves framework enhancements.

## Risk Culture

Effective risk management requires appropriate risk culture throughout the organization. We foster culture emphasizing:
- Transparency about risks and uncertainties
- Collective responsibility for risk awareness
- Empowerment to raise concerns and challenge assumptions
- Learning from mistakes and near-misses
- Balanced risk-taking aligned with fiduciary duties

Our compensation and incentive structures align with sound risk management, avoiding excessive risk-taking for short-term gains whilst rewarding sustainable value creation.

---

## Continuous Improvement

Risk management practices evolve with markets, regulations, and best practices. We commit to ongoing enhancement through:
- Regular framework reviews and updates
- Industry benchmarking and best practice adoption
- Technology and analytics capability investment
- Lessons learned from risk events and near-misses
- Stakeholder feedback integration
