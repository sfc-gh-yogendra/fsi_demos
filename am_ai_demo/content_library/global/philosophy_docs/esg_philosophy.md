## Our ESG Approach

At Snowcrest Asset Management, we believe that environmental, social, and governance factors are financially material and that companies demonstrating strong ESG practices are better positioned for sustainable long-term value creation. ESG integration is not a separate investment strategy but rather an essential component of rigorous fundamental analysis and prudent risk management.

Our approach to sustainable investing reflects three core beliefs. First, that ESG factors can significantly impact company valuations, competitive positioning, and business sustainability. Second, that active ownership and engagement with portfolio companies can drive positive change and enhance shareholder value. Third, that transparency and accountability in our own ESG practices strengthens client trust and demonstrates alignment with fiduciary responsibilities.

## Investment Integration Methodology

**Fundamental Analysis Enhancement**: ESG factors are systematically integrated into our company research and investment analysis processes. Our analysts evaluate material ESG risks and opportunities alongside traditional financial metrics, considering how sustainability factors impact competitive advantages, operational efficiency, regulatory risks, and stakeholder relationships.

Material ESG factors vary significantly across industries. In the energy sector, climate transition risks and carbon intensity are critical valuation drivers. For technology companies, data privacy, cybersecurity, and workforce practices carry greater materiality. Financial services firms face governance, conduct risk, and financial inclusion considerations. Our research framework identifies sector-specific material ESG factors and incorporates them appropriately into investment theses.

**Risk Assessment and Opportunity Identification**: ESG analysis serves as both a risk mitigation tool and an opportunity identification framework. Companies with poor ESG practices may face regulatory penalties, reputational damage, operational disruptions, or loss of social licence to operate. Conversely, ESG leaders often demonstrate superior risk management, operational excellence, and strategic foresight that create competitive advantages and support premium valuations.

We utilize multiple ESG data sources including third-party research providers, company disclosures, regulatory filings, and proprietary analysis. However, we maintain independence in our ESG assessments, recognizing that third-party ratings may not capture all material factors or company-specific circumstances. Our analysts combine quantitative ESG metrics with qualitative judgments to reach balanced ESG conclusions.

**Thematic Investing**: ESG considerations inform our thematic investment approach, where we identify structural trends driven by sustainability factors. Climate transition creates investment opportunities in renewable energy, energy efficiency, electric vehicles, and sustainable materials. Digital transformation themes encompass cybersecurity, data management, and responsible AI deployment. Social themes include healthcare innovation, financial inclusion, and human capital development.

## Active Ownership and Stewardship

**Engagement Strategy**: As long-term investors and active owners, we engage constructively with portfolio companies on material ESG matters. Our engagement priorities are determined by issue materiality, portfolio exposure, and potential for positive impact through dialogue. We seek to understand company perspectives, share investor expectations, and encourage enhanced ESG practices that support sustainable value creation.

Engagement typically involves direct meetings with company management, written correspondence on specific ESG topics, and participation in investor coalitions addressing industry-wide challenges. We document engagement activities, track management commitments, and assess progress over time. Successful engagement requires patience, credibility, and evidence-based advocacy grounded in financial materiality.

**Proxy Voting Principles**: We exercise voting rights as an integral component of active ownership. Our proxy voting approach is guided by assessment of proposals' potential impact on long-term shareholder value. We evaluate director elections based on board quality, independence, diversity, and relevant expertise. We assess executive compensation proposals for appropriate alignment with shareholder interests and ESG performance metrics.

On ESG-related shareholder proposals, we apply case-by-case analysis considering the materiality of issues raised, current company practices and disclosures, and potential benefits or costs of proposal implementation. We generally support proposals that enhance transparency on material ESG topics or strengthen board accountability for sustainability oversight.

**Collaborative Initiatives**: We participate in collaborative investor initiatives where collective engagement may prove more effective than individual efforts. Such initiatives include Climate Action 100+, focused on engaging high-emitting companies on climate strategies, and the Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI), supporting the global sustainable investment community.

## Thematic Focus Areas

**Climate Transition**: The global transition to a lower-carbon economy represents one of the defining investment themes of the coming decades. We seek exposure to companies enabling decarbonization through renewable energy generation, energy efficiency technologies, electric vehicle infrastructure, and sustainable materials innovation. Simultaneously, we assess climate transition risks for carbon-intensive businesses, evaluating their adaptation strategies and long-term viability.

**Digital Innovation and Responsible Technology**: Technological advancement drives productivity growth, creates new markets, and disrupts established industries. We focus on companies leading innovation in cloud computing, artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and digital payments. Critically, we evaluate how companies address responsible technology development including data privacy, algorithmic accountability, and cybersecurity resilience.

**Social Impact and Human Capital**: Companies that invest in workforce development, maintain diverse and inclusive cultures, and demonstrate strong stakeholder relationships often exhibit superior long-term performance. We favour companies with progressive human capital practices, equitable workplace policies, and positive community impacts. Healthcare innovation, educational technology, and financial inclusion represent attractive social impact investment themes.

**Corporate Governance Excellence**: Strong governance provides the foundation for sustainable value creation. We seek companies with independent, diverse, and qualified boards, appropriate management incentive structures, and robust risk management frameworks. Transparency, shareholder rights, and ethical business conduct are essential governance characteristics we evaluate across all investments.

## Measurement, Reporting, and Continuous Improvement

**ESG Metrics and Measurement**: We track portfolio-level ESG metrics including weighted average ESG ratings, carbon footprint analysis, board diversity statistics, and ESG controversy monitoring. These metrics provide insights into portfolio ESG characteristics and support client reporting requirements.

**Impact Assessment**: For strategies with explicit sustainability objectives, we measure and report on impact metrics relevant to strategy goals. This may include greenhouse gas emissions avoided, renewable energy capacity supported, or social outcomes achieved. Impact measurement methodologies continue to evolve, and we commit to adopting best practices as industry standards mature.

**Transparency and Stakeholder Communication**: We publish an annual Responsible Investment Report detailing our ESG integration practices, engagement activities, proxy voting record, and portfolio sustainability metrics. This transparency supports client understanding of our approach and holds us accountable to stated commitments.

**Continuous Evolution**: Sustainable investment practices, data availability, and stakeholder expectations continue to evolve rapidly. We commit to ongoing enhancement of our ESG integration capabilities through research investment, team development, technology infrastructure, and industry collaboration. Annual reviews of this philosophy ensure alignment with best practices and client expectations.
