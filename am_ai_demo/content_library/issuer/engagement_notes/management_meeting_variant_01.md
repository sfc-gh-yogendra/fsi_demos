## Key Discussion Points

**Environmental Strategy**: {{ISSUER_NAME}} provided updates on progress toward emissions reduction targets, noting a {{EMISSIONS_REDUCTION}}% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 emissions since the baseline year. Management acknowledged that Scope 3 measurement requires improvement and committed to publishing comprehensive Scope 3 inventory in the next sustainability report. The company is evaluating science-based targets but has not yet made formal commitments.

**Social Initiatives**: Discussion covered workforce diversity metrics, with management sharing data on gender and ethnic diversity across management levels. The company has implemented unconscious bias training, enhanced recruitment practices to broaden candidate pools, and established employee resource groups to support inclusive culture. Progress is evident though management acknowledged continued work is needed, particularly at senior leadership levels.

**Governance Matters**: Board composition was discussed, including plans for upcoming director elections. Management indicated openness to adding directors with relevant ESG expertise and confirmed commitment to board refreshment. Executive compensation structures include ESG metrics, though the weighting and specific metrics could be enhanced to drive greater accountability.

## SAM Assessment

Management demonstrated genuine engagement with ESG topics and awareness of investor expectations. The commitments made are specific and measurable, allowing for objective assessment of follow-through.
