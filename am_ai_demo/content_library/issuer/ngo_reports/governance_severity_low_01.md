## Key Findings

**Board Independence**: {{ISSUER_NAME}}'s board comprises {{BOARD_SIZE}} directors, with {{INDEPENDENT_COUNT}} classified as independent under applicable listing standards. This {{INDEPENDENCE_PCT}}% independence rate meets regulatory requirements and is consistent with governance norms. The independent board members bring relevant expertise and appear to exercise appropriate oversight.

Whilst this represents progress from previous years, it falls somewhat below the {{SIC_DESCRIPTION}} sector median of {{SECTOR_MEDIAN}}%. Ethnic and experiential diversity could also be enhanced through future director appointments.

**Committee Structure**: Audit, Compensation, and Nominating/Governance committees are composed entirely of independent directors, which aligns with best practices. Committee chairs possess appropriate expertise and tenure. Meeting frequency appears adequate for effective oversight.

**Board Refreshment**: Average board tenure is {{AVERAGE_TENURE}} years, suggesting balanced mix of institutional knowledge and fresh perspectives. The company has added {{NEW_DIRECTORS}} new directors in the past three years, demonstrating appropriate board refreshment.
