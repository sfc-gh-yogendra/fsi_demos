## Background and Context

The FCA introduced Consumer Duty as a paradigm shift in consumer protection regulation, moving beyond prescriptive rules toward outcomes-based standards. The Duty requires firms to act in good faith, avoid foreseeable harm, and enable customers to pursue their financial objectives.

**Regulatory Goals**:
- Raise consumer protection standards across financial services
- Shift firm culture toward consumer outcomes focus
- Reduce consumer harm through proactive firm action
- Increase competition through better consumer understanding and switching

**Industry Context**: Consumer Duty represents most significant regulatory change in UK retail financial services in recent years. Firms must demonstrate ongoing assessment of consumer outcomes with corrective action when outcomes fall short.

## Key Requirements

### 1. Consumer Principle and Cross-Cutting Rules

**Consumer Principle**: A firm must act to deliver good outcomes for retail customers.

**Cross-Cutting Rules**:
- **Act in Good Faith**: Honest, fair treatment of customers
- **Avoid Foreseeable Harm**: Identify and mitigate potential consumer harm proactively
- **Enable and Support**: Help customers pursue financial objectives through appropriate product design and communications

### 2. Four Outcomes

**Products and Services Outcome**: Products and services designed to meet needs and characteristics of target customer groups. Regular assessment of whether products provide fair value.

**Price and Value Outcome**: Price represents fair value considering benefits provided, comparable products, and customer needs. Value assessments required with corrective action if poor value identified.

**Consumer Understanding Outcome**: Communications designed for target audience comprehension. Test consumer understanding and adjust communications when testing reveals comprehension gaps.

**Consumer Support Outcome**: Customer service meets needs throughout relationship. Support enabling customers to make informed decisions and change products/services when appropriate.
