The rulemaking aims to improve transparency, strengthen investor protections, and modernize disclosure frameworks for the digital age.

**Regulatory Objectives**:
- Increase transparency around adviser fees, services, and conflicts of interest
- Strengthen cybersecurity risk disclosure given increasing digital threats
- Improve investor ability to compare advisers and make informed decisions
- Enhance regulatory oversight through more frequent reporting

**Industry Context**: These changes reflect the SEC's ongoing focus on investment adviser regulation following increased retail participation in markets and growth of digital advice platforms. The requirements align US standards more closely with international regulatory frameworks including MiFID II transparency provisions.
