**Snowcrest Asset Management**

+44 20 1234 5678 | www.snowcrestam.com

Snowcrest Asset Management is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as an investment adviser. Investment advisory services and fees differ from brokerage services and fees, and it is important for you to understand these differences. Free and simple tools are available to research firms and financial professionals at **Investor.gov/CRS**, which also provides educational materials about investment advisers, broker-dealers, and investing.

## WHAT INVESTMENT SERVICES AND ADVICE CAN YOU PROVIDE ME?

We offer investment advisory services to retail investors, including discretionary portfolio management on an ongoing basis. We will:

- **Monitor your portfolio** at least quarterly, reviewing performance, holdings, and alignment with your investment goals
- **Make investment decisions for you** (discretionary authority) based on your Investment Policy Statement, without requiring your approval for each trade
- **Invest primarily in stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and ETFs** selected through our fundamental research process
- **Customize your portfolio** based on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and any specific restrictions you impose

**Account Minimum**: We generally require a minimum account size of £2 million to open and maintain an account, though we may waive this requirement in certain circumstances.

**Limitations**: Our investment advice is limited to securities and investment products appropriate for your mandate. We do not offer proprietary products, insurance products, or banking services.

**Additional Information**: For more detailed information about our services, see Items 4 and 7 of our Form ADV Part 2A available at www.snowcrestam.com/disclosures.

### CONVERSATION STARTERS — ASK YOUR FINANCIAL PROFESSIONAL:
- *Given my financial situation, should I choose an investment advisory service? Why or why not?*
- *How will you choose investments to recommend to me?*
- *What is your relevant experience, including your licenses, education, and other qualifications? What do these qualifications mean?*

---

## WHAT FEES WILL I PAY?

**Asset-Based Fees**: You will pay us an ongoing quarterly fee based on the value of assets in your account. Our standard fee schedule is:

- First £5 million: 0.90% annually (0.225% quarterly)
- Next £10 million: 0.65% annually (0.1625% quarterly)
- Over £15 million: 0.45% annually (0.1125% quarterly)

**Fee Impact**: The more assets you have in your account, the more you will pay us in fees, which gives us an incentive to encourage you to increase your account value. Fees are calculated based on account value each quarter and deducted from your account.

**Other Fees and Costs**: You will also pay:
- **Custodian fees** for account maintenance and safekeeping
- **Transaction costs** (commissions and spreads) when we buy or sell investments
- **Fund expenses** if invested in mutual funds or ETFs (typically 0.05%-1.00% annually)

**Important**: You will pay fees and costs whether you make or lose money on your investments. Fees and costs will reduce any amount of money you make on your investments over time. Please make sure you understand what fees and costs you are paying.

**Additional Information**: For more detailed fee information, see Item 5 of our Form ADV Part 2A available at www.snowcrestam.com/disclosures.

### CONVERSATION STARTER — ASK YOUR FINANCIAL PROFESSIONAL:
- *Help me understand how these fees and costs might affect my investments. If I give you £100,000 to invest, how much will go to fees and costs, and how much will be invested for me?*

## WHAT ARE YOUR LEGAL OBLIGATIONS TO ME WHEN ACTING AS MY INVESTMENT ADVISER? HOW ELSE DOES YOUR FIRM MAKE MONEY AND WHAT CONFLICTS OF INTEREST DO YOU HAVE?

**When we act as your investment adviser, we have to act in your best interest and not put our interest ahead of yours.** At the same time, the way we make money creates some conflicts with your interests. You should understand and ask us about these conflicts because they can affect the investment advice we provide you.

**Examples of Conflicts**:

**Asset-Based Fees**: The more assets in your account, the more you will pay in fees. This gives us an incentive to encourage you to increase the assets in your account, including through deposits of additional assets or through investment gains.

**Custodian Benefits**: We receive technology and practice management support from custodians we recommend. This creates an incentive to recommend custodians providing us greater benefits versus custodians offering better terms to clients.

**Additional Information**: For more information about our conflicts of interest, see Items 10, 11, and 12 of our Form ADV Part 2A available at www.snowcrestam.com/disclosures.

### CONVERSATION STARTER — ASK YOUR FINANCIAL PROFESSIONAL:
- *How might your conflicts of interest affect me, and how will you address them?*

---

## HOW DO YOUR FINANCIAL PROFESSIONALS MAKE MONEY?

Our financial professionals are compensated through:
- Base salary
- Annual bonus based on firm profitability and individual performance
- Equity ownership in the firm (senior professionals)

Bonuses consider factors including client satisfaction, investment performance, compliance record, and contribution to firm success. This structure aligns our professionals' interests with client interests and long-term firm success rather than creating incentives for unsuitable recommendations or excessive trading.

---

## DO YOU OR YOUR FINANCIAL PROFESSIONALS HAVE LEGAL OR DISCIPLINARY HISTORY?

**No.** Neither our firm nor our financial professionals have disciplinary history to disclose.

Visit **Investor.gov/CRS** for a free and simple search tool to research our firm and our financial professionals.

### CONVERSATION STARTER — ASK YOUR FINANCIAL PROFESSIONAL:
- *As a financial professional, do you have any disciplinary history? For what type of conduct?*
