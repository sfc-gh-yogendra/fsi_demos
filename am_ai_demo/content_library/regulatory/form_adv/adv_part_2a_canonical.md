## ITEM 5: FEES AND COMPENSATION

### A. Fee Schedule

**Investment Management Fees** (asset-based, annual rates):

| Assets Under Management | Annual Fee Rate |
|------------------------|----------------|
| First £5 million | 0.90% |
| Next £10 million | 0.65% |
| Next £35 million | 0.45% |
| Over £50 million | Negotiable |

**Minimum Account Size**: £2 million (may be waived for related accounts or special circumstances)

**Institutional Separate Account Fees**: Negotiated based on account size, strategy complexity, and service requirements. Typically range from 0.25% to 0.75% annually depending on mandate size.

### B. Fee Billing

Fees are calculated quarterly based on market value as of the last business day of each calendar quarter. Fees may be billed in advance or arrears as specified in client agreement.

Fees are typically deducted directly from client accounts with client authorization. Alternatively, clients may choose to receive invoices and remit payment separately.

Pro-rated fees apply for partial quarter periods based on account funding or termination dates.

### C. Other Fees and Expenses

Clients incur additional costs beyond our advisory fees:

**Custodian Fees**: Account maintenance, safekeeping, and transaction fees charged by custodian. Custodian fee schedules provided separately.

**Transaction Costs**: Brokerage commissions, trade execution spreads, and regulatory fees on securities transactions. We seek best execution and competitive commission rates but do not control these costs directly.

**Fund Expenses**: Clients invested in mutual funds or ETFs incur fund expense ratios, typically 0.05% to 1.00% annually depending on fund type. Fund expenses are embedded in fund pricing and reduce fund returns.

**Other Charges**: Wire transfer fees, account statement fees, legal fees (extraordinary circumstances), and other incidental expenses.

### D. Advance Payment and Termination

Clients billed in advance receive pro-rated refund of unearned fees upon termination. Clients billed in arrears owe fees only for period services were provided. Either party may terminate advisory relationship upon 30 days written notice without penalty.

### E. External Compensation

Snowcrest Asset Management does not accept commissions, referral fees, 12b-1 fees, or other compensation from third parties for client investment recommendations. We are compensated solely by clients for investment advisory services, eliminating conflicts from external compensation.

---

## ITEM 6: PERFORMANCE-BASED FEES AND SIDE-BY-SIDE MANAGEMENT

Snowcrest Asset Management does not charge performance-based fees or incentive allocations. All fees are asset-based or fixed as described in Item 5. This eliminates conflicts between performance fee accounts and asset-based fee accounts.

---

## ITEM 7: TYPES OF CLIENTS

- High Net Worth Individuals and Families
- Family Offices
- Pension and Profit Sharing Plans
- Endowments and Foundations

**Account Minimum**: £2 million for separately managed accounts. Lower minimums may be accepted for related accounts, employee accounts, or special circumstances at our discretion.

---

## ITEM 8: METHODS OF ANALYSIS, INVESTMENT STRATEGIES, AND RISK OF LOSS

### A. Methods of Analysis

**Fundamental Analysis**: Primary analytical method involves detailed company and industry analysis including financial statement examination, competitive positioning assessment, management quality evaluation, and valuation analysis using multiple methodologies (DCF, comparable companies, precedent transactions).

**ESG Analysis**: Environmental, social, and governance factors integrated into fundamental analysis. Material ESG risks and opportunities identified and incorporated into investment valuations and decisions.

**Quantitative Analysis**: Factor analysis, risk modeling, and quantitative screening complement fundamental research. Portfolio construction optimizes risk-adjusted returns considering correlations and factor exposures.

### B. Investment Strategies

**Long-Term Equity Investing**: Focus on high-quality companies with sustainable competitive advantages, strong management teams, and attractive valuations. Typical holding periods 3-5 years.

**Fixed Income Management**: Credit-focused approach emphasizing capital preservation, income generation, and duration management aligned with client objectives and rate outlook.

**ESG Integration**: Systematic incorporation of sustainability factors into investment analysis. Exclusion of controversial weapons and high-severity ESG controversies. Active ownership through engagement and proxy voting.

**Thematic Investing**: Strategies focused on structural trends including technology innovation, climate transition, demographic changes, and digital transformation.

### C. Material Risks

Investing in securities involves risk of loss that clients should be prepared to bear:

**Market Risk**: Equity and bond markets can decline significantly during market downturns. No guarantee of positive returns in any period.

**Interest Rate Risk**: Bond prices fall when interest rates rise. Duration management mitigates but doesn't eliminate this risk.

**Credit Risk**: Bond issuers may default on obligations. Credit rating downgrades negatively impact prices.

**Liquidity Risk**: Some securities may be difficult to sell quickly without price concessions. Illiquid positions may require selling at unfavorable prices during market stress.

**Concentration Risk**: Focused portfolios accepting higher concentration may experience greater volatility than diversified portfolios.

**Currency Risk**: International investments subject to currency fluctuations (we typically hedge major currency exposures).

**Manager Risk**: Our active management decisions may underperform passive index approaches. No guarantee our strategies will achieve objectives.

---

## ITEM 9: DISCIPLINARY INFORMATION

Neither Snowcrest Asset Management nor its management persons have been involved in any legal or disciplinary events material to evaluation of our advisory business or the integrity of our management.

---

## ITEM 10: OTHER FINANCIAL INDUSTRY ACTIVITIES AND AFFILIATIONS

### A. Broker-Dealer Registration

Neither the Firm nor our management persons are registered or have applications pending to register as broker-dealer or registered representative of broker-dealer.

### B. Futures/Commodities Registration

Neither the Firm nor our management persons are registered or have applications pending with the CFTC as futures commission merchant, commodity pool operator, commodity trading adviser, or associated persons.

### C. Material Relationships

The Firm has no material relationships or arrangements with related persons including broker-dealers, investment companies, other investment advisers, financial planning firms, banking institutions, accounting firms, or law firms that create material conflicts of interest with clients.

---

## ITEM 11: CODE OF ETHICS, PARTICIPATION IN CLIENT TRANSACTIONS, AND PERSONAL TRADING

### A. Code of Ethics

We have adopted a Code of Ethics establishing our commitment to ethical conduct and fiduciary standards. The Code requires:
- Placing client interests first in all decisions
- Avoiding conflicts of interest or full disclosure when conflicts exist
- Maintaining confidentiality of client information
- Acting with honesty, integrity, and good faith
- Compliance with securities laws and regulations

A copy of our Code of Ethics is available to clients upon request.

### B. Personal Trading

Covered Persons may invest in same securities as clients, subject to Code of Ethics restrictions:

**Pre-Clearance**: Personnel must pre-clear most securities transactions 24 hours in advance. Pre-clearance ensures no conflicts with client trading and no material non-public information.

**Blackout Periods**: Trading blackouts before and after client trades, during quarterly period-end, and while possessing material non-public information.

**Holding Periods**: 30-day minimum holding period for purchased securities reduces short-term trading.

**Reporting**: Quarterly transaction reports, annual holdings certification, duplicate brokerage statements to CCO.

### C. Conflicts of Interest from Personal Trading

Personal trading creates potential conflicts:
- Personnel could benefit from information about firm's trading or recommendations
- Personnel could trade ahead of client trades (front-running)

**Mitigation**: Pre-clearance system prevents trading ahead of clients. CCO reviews all personal trading. Violations result in disciplinary action including disgorgement of profits and potential termination.

---

## ITEM 12: BROKERAGE PRACTICES

### A. Broker-Dealer Selection

**Best Execution Standard**: We seek best execution of client trades considering price, execution speed, reliability, and total transaction costs.

**Broker Selection Factors**:
- Price competitiveness and execution quality
- Operational capabilities and error rates
- Financial stability and reputation
- Research services (soft dollars, see below)

**Recommended Custodians**: We recommend institutional custodians including [Custodian 1], [Custodian 2], and [Custodian 3] based on service quality, custody fees, and technology platforms. Clients open accounts directly with custodians.

### B. Soft Dollar Benefits

We may receive research and brokerage services from broker-dealers that qualify as soft dollar benefits under Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act. Services include:

- Third-party research reports and databases
- Market data and analytics platforms
- Portfolio management and trading systems

Soft dollar benefits create conflicts as we may have incentive to select broker-dealers based on research value rather than solely execution quality. We address this through:
- Evaluating execution quality independently of research services
- Documenting that research and brokerage services benefit clients
- Allocating soft dollar costs appropriately across client accounts

### C. Brokerage for Client Referrals

We do not consider client referrals from broker-dealers in selecting or recommending broker-dealers.

### D. Directed Brokerage

Clients may direct us to use specific broker-dealers. Directed brokerage may prevent us from achieving best execution and may result in higher commissions or less favorable prices. Directed brokerage accounts cannot participate in aggregated orders with other accounts.

### E. Order Aggregation

We aggregate (bunch) orders for multiple clients when possible to achieve better execution:
- **Benefits**: Potentially lower transaction costs and improved execution
- **Allocation**: Pro-rated based on order sizes
- **Partial Fills**: Allocated fairly across participating accounts
- **No Preferential Treatment**: No accounts receive systematically more favorable treatment

---

## ITEM 13: REVIEW OF ACCOUNTS

### A. Periodic Reviews

**Quarterly Portfolio Reviews**: All discretionary accounts reviewed at least quarterly by assigned portfolio manager. Reviews assess performance, asset allocation versus targets, holdings appropriateness, and client circumstance changes.

**Triggers for Non-Periodic Reviews**:
- Material market events affecting portfolio holdings
- Changes in client financial situation or objectives
- Significant portfolio losses (>10% drawdown)
- Client requests or concerns

### B. Reports to Clients

**Quarterly Performance Reports**: Comprehensive reports including performance versus benchmarks, attribution analysis, holdings detail, asset allocation, and portfolio activity summary.

**Annual Review**: In-depth annual review including multi-year performance analysis, IPS review and recommendations, and comprehensive portfolio analytics.

**Monthly Custodian Statements**: Clients receive monthly statements directly from custodian showing all holdings, transactions, and market values.

---

## ITEM 14: CLIENT REFERRALS AND OTHER COMPENSATION

### A. Economic Benefits from Non-Clients

Our custodian relationships provide certain economic benefits including technology platforms, practice management support, and research access at no additional charge. These benefits create potential conflict as we may have incentive to recommend custodians providing greater benefits versus other factors. We address this by evaluating custodians based primarily on service quality, pricing, and client benefits rather than services provided to our firm.

### B. Compensation for Client Referrals

We do not compensate non-supervised persons for client referrals. We do not have solicitor arrangements or pay referral fees.

---

## ITEM 15: CUSTODY

Clients' funds and securities are held by qualified custodians: [List approved custodians]. Custodians send statements directly to clients at least quarterly showing all account activity, holdings, and values.

We have limited custody because we debit advisory fees directly from client accounts with client authorization. Custodian statements show fee deductions. Clients should verify fee calculations match agreed fee schedules.

Clients should carefully review custodian statements and compare with any reports we provide. Contact us promptly with any questions or discrepancies.

---

## ITEM 16: INVESTMENT DISCRETION

We typically provide investment advisory services on discretionary basis, meaning we make investment decisions without obtaining client approval for each transaction.

**Discretionary Authority Includes**:
- Securities to buy and sell
- Amount of securities to trade
- Timing of transactions
- Broker-dealer selection (subject to any client-directed brokerage)

**Limitations on Discretion**:
- Must follow Investment Policy Statement guidelines
- Must adhere to client-imposed restrictions
- Cannot withdraw funds except for fee deduction (with authorization)

Discretionary authority is granted through Investment Management Agreement and documented in custodian account opening paperwork. Limitations are documented in Investment Policy Statements.

---

## ITEM 17: VOTING CLIENT SECURITIES

### A. Proxy Voting Authority

We will vote proxies on behalf of clients unless client retains voting authority. Our Proxy Voting Policies are available upon request and summarize our approach to proxy voting.

### B. Proxy Voting Procedures

We vote proxies in clients' best interest considering proposal's impact on shareholder value. Key considerations:
- Director elections: Independence, qualifications, diversity
- Executive compensation: Alignment with performance and shareholder interests
- Corporate governance proposals: Board structure, shareholder rights
- ESG proposals: Material sustainability matters and disclosure enhancement

Conflicts of interest in proxy voting are resolved by independent third-party recommendations or client consultation.

### C. Obtaining Proxy Voting Records

Clients may request information about how we voted their proxies by contacting us at compliance@snowcrestam.com.

### D. Class Action Lawsuits

We do not provide advice or take action regarding class action participation. Clients receive notices directly from custodians and may pursue participation independently.

---

## ITEM 18: FINANCIAL INFORMATION

### A. Balance Sheet

We are not required to provide balance sheet because we do not require or solicit prepayment of fees six or more months in advance.

### B. Financial Condition

We are not aware of any financial condition reasonably likely to impair our ability to meet contractual commitments to clients. The Firm maintains adequate capital, liquidity, and professional indemnity insurance to support ongoing operations and client service.

### C. Bankruptcy

Snowcrest Asset Management has not been the subject of bankruptcy petition at any time.

---

## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
