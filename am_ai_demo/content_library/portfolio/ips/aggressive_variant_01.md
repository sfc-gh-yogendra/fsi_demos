## 1. Purpose

This Investment Policy Statement establishes objectives, guidelines, and constraints for the {{PORTFOLIO_NAME}}, an aggressive growth-oriented investment strategy. The IPS provides governance framework for maximising long-term capital appreciation through concentrated exposure to high-growth equities and thematic investment opportunities.

---

## 2. Investment Objectives

**Primary Objective**: Maximum long-term capital appreciation through concentrated equity investments in high-growth companies and emerging technology themes. The portfolio explicitly prioritises growth over income generation or capital preservation.

**Return Target**: 10-15% annualised return over market cycle (5-7 years), accepting significant year-to-year variance. Target meaningfully exceeds broad market returns through active management and thematic focus.

**Risk Profile**: Aggressive risk tolerance accepting substantial volatility and drawdown potential in exchange for higher expected returns. Comfortable with annual volatility of 18-25% and potential drawdowns of 30-40% during market corrections.

**Time Horizon**: Long-term horizon of 10+ years allowing strategy to withstand significant market volatility whilst compounding through growth cycles.

## 3. Strategic Asset Allocation

**Target Allocation**:

| Asset Class | Target % | Minimum % | Maximum % | Benchmark |
|-------------|----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| **Equities** | **90%** | **80%** | **95%** | |
| - Growth Equities | 70% | 50% | 85% | Nasdaq 100 |
| - International Growth | 15% | 10% | 25% | MSCI ACWI ex-US Growth |
| - Small/Mid Cap Growth | 5% | 0% | 15% | Russell 2000 Growth |
| **Alternatives** | **5%** | **0%** | **10%** | |
| - Thematic ETFs | 5% | 0% | 10% | Various |
| **Cash** | **5%** | **0%** | **20%** | Cash |
| **TOTAL** | **100%** | | | |

**Allocation Rationale**: The 90% equity allocation maximises growth potential whilst maintaining modest cash buffer for tactical opportunities and rebalancing. Growth equity focus targets companies with superior revenue expansion characteristics. Concentrated positioning in highest-conviction ideas differentiates from passive indexing.

## 4. Investment Guidelines

**Permitted Investments**:
- Individual equities across all market capitalisations
- Growth-oriented mutual funds and ETFs
- Thematic investment vehicles (AI, renewable energy, cybersecurity, etc.)
- Small/mid-cap companies with strong growth profiles
- International equities in developed and emerging markets

**Concentration Approach**:
- Maximum 15% in single issuer (high-conviction threshold)
- Early warning at 12% triggers review
- Maximum 50% in single sector (allows thematic concentration)
- Top 10 holdings may represent 55-70% of portfolio (concentrated approach)
- Minimum position size 2% (avoid over-diversification)

**Quality Preferences** (Guidelines not Constraints):
- Companies with revenue growth >15% annually preferred
- Positive or path to positive free cash flow within 24 months
- Strong competitive positioning and defensible moats
- Experienced management teams with skin in the game

**Investment Restrictions**:
- No leveraged derivatives or short selling
- No individual fixed income securities

**Thematic Focus**: Portfolio emphasises technology innovation themes including artificial intelligence, cloud computing, digital transformation, cybersecurity, renewable energy transition, and emerging consumer trends.

## 5. Risk Management

**Concentration Risk**: Accepted and managed through research conviction and active monitoring. High-conviction positions may exceed 10% when supported by rigorous analysis and Investment Committee approval.

**Sector Concentration**: Technology sector exposure may reach 60-70% of portfolio, reflecting thematic focus and growth objectives. Concentration monitored but explicitly permitted within strategy mandate.

**Volatility Management**: High volatility expected and accepted. No volatility targeting or defensive positioning requirements. Focus on long-term growth rather than short-term volatility minimization.

**Downside Protection**: Quality bias (profitable or path to profit, strong balance sheets) provides modest downside protection. Active monitoring and willingness to exit deteriorating positions mitigate permanent capital loss risk.
