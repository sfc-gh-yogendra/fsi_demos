## 2. Investment Objectives

**Primary Objective**: Capital preservation with modest income generation and minimal volatility. The portfolio seeks stable returns whilst protecting principal from significant loss.

**Return Target**: 4-5% annualised return over full market cycle (5-7 years), acknowledging returns will vary annually. This target aims to modestly exceed inflation whilst maintaining conservative risk profile.

**Risk Objective**: Minimise volatility and drawdown risk. Target maximum annual volatility of 6-9% and peak-to-trough drawdown not exceeding 12% during market stress. Conservative risk tolerance reflects capital preservation priority.

**Time Horizon**: Medium-term horizon of 5-7 years allows for modest equity exposure whilst maintaining predominant fixed income allocation for stability.

## 3. Strategic Asset Allocation

**Target Allocation and Ranges**:

| Asset Class | Target % | Minimum % | Maximum % | Benchmark |
|-------------|----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| **Fixed Income** | **65%** | **55%** | **75%** | |
| - Investment Grade Bonds | 50% | 40% | 60% | Bloomberg Global Aggregate |
| - Government Bonds | 15% | 10% | 25% | Bloomberg Treasury |
| **Equities** | **25%** | **15%** | **35%** | |
| - Large Cap Developed | 20% | 15% | 30% | MSCI World |
| - Dividend-Focused | 5% | 0% | 10% | MSCI World High Dividend |
| **Alternatives** | **5%** | **0%** | **10%** | |
| - Real Estate (REITs) | 5% | 0% | 8% | FTSE NAREIT |
| **Cash & Equivalents** | **5%** | **2%** | **15%** | Cash |
| **TOTAL** | **100%** | | | |

**Allocation Rationale**: The 65/25/10 fixed income/equity/alternatives allocation reflects conservative risk profile prioritising capital preservation and income generation. Fixed income provides stability and regular income. Modest equity exposure offers growth potential and inflation protection. Conservative positioning appropriate for risk tolerance and objectives.
