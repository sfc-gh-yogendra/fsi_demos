## 2. Investment Objectives

**Primary Objective**: The {{PORTFOLIO_NAME}} seeks to achieve long-term capital appreciation with moderate income generation through a diversified portfolio of global equities and fixed income securities. The portfolio targets total returns that exceed the performance of a balanced benchmark whilst maintaining volatility within acceptable parameters.

**Return Objective**: The portfolio targets an annualized return of 6-8% over a full market cycle (typically 5-7 years), with the understanding that returns will vary significantly in any given year. This return objective is designed to preserve purchasing power after inflation whilst generating modest real growth.

**Risk Objective**: The portfolio accepts moderate levels of volatility and drawdown risk in pursuit of return objectives. Target maximum annual volatility of 10-14% and maximum peak-to-trough drawdown of 20% during periods of market stress. The moderate risk profile balances growth objectives with capital preservation considerations.

**Time Horizon**: The portfolio is managed with a long-term investment horizon of 7+ years, allowing for short-term market volatility to be absorbed whilst focusing on fundamental value creation. This extended time horizon permits equity exposure appropriate for achieving return objectives.

---

## 3. Risk Tolerance and Capacity

**Risk Tolerance Assessment**: Moderate risk tolerance reflecting willingness to accept portfolio volatility and potential short-term losses in exchange for higher expected long-term returns compared to conservative strategies. Comfortable with market drawdowns of 15-20% during periods of equity market stress.

**Risk Capacity**: Financial capacity to absorb temporary portfolio declines without requiring liquidations at inopportune times. Adequate liquidity outside this portfolio for near-term needs, allowing portfolio to remain fully invested according to strategic asset allocation.

**Loss Parameters**: Maximum acceptable annual loss of 15% in any single calendar year. Maximum acceptable drawdown from peak portfolio value of 20%. These parameters guide both strategic asset allocation and tactical risk management decisions.

## 4. Strategic Asset Allocation

**Target Asset Allocation and Ranges**:

| Asset Class | Target % | Minimum % | Maximum % | Benchmark |
|-------------|----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| **Equities** | **60%** | **50%** | **70%** | |
| - Developed Markets | 45% | 35% | 55% | MSCI World |
| - Emerging Markets | 10% | 5% | 15% | MSCI Emerging Markets |
| - Small/Mid Cap | 5% | 0% | 10% | Russell 2000 |
| **Fixed Income** | **35%** | **25%** | **45%** | |
| - Investment Grade | 25% | 15% | 35% | Bloomberg Global Aggregate |
| - High Yield | 7% | 0% | 12% | ICE BofA HY Index |
| - Government Bonds | 3% | 0% | 8% | Bloomberg Treasury |
| **Alternatives** | **3%** | **0%** | **8%** | |
| - Real Estate (REITs) | 2% | 0% | 5% | FTSE NAREIT All Equity |
| - Commodities | 1% | 0% | 3% | Bloomberg Commodity |
| **Cash & Equivalents** | **2%** | **0%** | **10%** | Cash |
| **TOTAL** | **100%** | | | |

**Allocation Rationale**: The 60/40 equity-to-fixed income strategic allocation reflects the moderate risk profile and balanced return objectives. Equity exposure provides growth potential and inflation protection, whilst fixed income contributes income generation, volatility reduction, and portfolio diversification. The inclusion of alternative investments enhances diversification and provides access to differentiated return sources.

**Rebalancing Policy**: Review asset class weights quarterly. Rebalance when any asset class deviates more than 5 percentage points from target allocation. Consider tax implications and transaction costs before executing rebalancing trades. Utilize cash flows and distributions for rebalancing when possible to minimize transaction costs.
