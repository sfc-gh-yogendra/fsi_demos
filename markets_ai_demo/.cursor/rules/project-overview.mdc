# Frost Markets Intelligence - Snowflake AI Demo Project

## Project Overview
This is a demo showcasing Snowflake AI capabilities for financial markets research. The fictional company "Frost Markets Intelligence" demonstrates AI-powered workflows for equity research and market insights analysis.

## Key Project Constraints
- **Demo-only**: Optimized for demonstration, not production use
- **Fictional data**: All companies, clients, and market data are synthetic
- **Real tickers**: Use actual stock symbols (AAPL, MSFT, etc.) with synthetic data
- **Modular design**: Each demo scenario is completely self-contained (15-minute segments)
- **Phase 1**: Focus on Equity Research Analyst scenarios first
- **Phase 2**: Add Global Research & Market Insights Analyst scenarios later

## Target Architecture
- **Database**: MARKETS_AI_DEMO with multiple schemas (RAW, CURATED, AI)
- **Personas**: 2 main personas, 4 separate agents (2 scenarios per persona)
- **Data Volume**: Minimal viable dataset (10-15 companies, 20-25 clients, 1 year history)
- **Events**: 5-10 major market events driving cross-scenario correlations

## Demo Flow
Each scenario must be completely independent and self-contained. No dependencies between scenarios.
