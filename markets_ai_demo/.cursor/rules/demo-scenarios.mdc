## Scenario Independence Requirements
- Each scenario must work without prior context
- No data dependencies between scenarios
- Complete setup/teardown for each scenario
- Self-contained datasets and configurations

## User Interaction Flow Pattern
Each scenario follows a 3-4 question conversation:
1. **Initial Question**: Broad request that demonstrates core capability
2. **Follow-up Question**: Drill down or cross-reference data sources
3. **Analysis/Visualization Request**: Chart, table, or deeper analysis
4. **Action Item**: Generate summary, report, alert, or recommendation

## Data Requirements Per Scenario
- All agent questions must have supporting synthetic data
- Responses should showcase multiple Snowflake AI features
- Cross-reference capabilities between structured and unstructured data
- Realistic but impressive results that highlight AI value
- **CRITICAL**: All data must use dynamic dates for demo relevance:
  - Earnings questions reference current/recent quarters
  - Market events span realistic timeframes relative to demo date
  - Research reports cite current market conditions
  - Client data reflects recent engagement patterns
  - Macro signals show current levels and recent trends
  - Firm positions reflect latest as-of dates

## Agent Tool Configuration Patterns

### Cortex Analyst Tools
