## 🏦 Scenario 1: Global Research & Market Insights - Market Structure Reports (15 minutes)

### Business Context Setup (2 minutes)

**Persona**: Market Structure Analyst at Frost Markets Intelligence

**Business Challenge**: 
"Traditional market structure research is reactive and generic. By the time we publish quarterly reports, the content is already consensus. More critically, we can't easily identify which clients should be prioritized for strategic discussions on emerging regulatory changes like EMIR 3.0."

**Value Proposition**:
- **Hyper-Personalization**: Transform generic reports into client-specific insights
- **Engagement Analytics**: Measure which topics resonate with different client segments
- **Strategic Targeting**: Identify high-value clients for proactive outreach
- **Regulatory Intelligence**: Faster identification of regulatory impact by client trading patterns

**AI Tools in Use**:
- **CLIENT_MARKET_IMPACT_VIEW**: Client analytics combining trading, engagement, and discussion data
- **RESEARCH_REPORTS_SEARCH**: Market structure content discovery
- **NEWS_ARTICLES_SEARCH**: Latest regulatory developments
- **Cortex Complete**: Personalized content generation

### Demo Flow

#### Setup (30 seconds)
