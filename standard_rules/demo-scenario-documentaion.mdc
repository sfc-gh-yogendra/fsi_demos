**Expected Response**:
- List of breaches by portfolio and rule type
- Flag positions >7% with "🚨 BREACH" and >6.5% with "⚠️ WARNING"
- Severity assessment with exact percentages
- Affected positions with amounts and percentages
```

### Alignment with Agent Instructions
Ensure all expected flagging behaviors are reflected in corresponding agent instructions.

## Quality Standards

## Examples of Good vs Bad Documentation

### ✅ Good Example - Business Challenge
```markdown
**Business Challenge**: Portfolio managers need instant access to portfolio analytics, holdings information, and supporting research to make informed investment decisions. Traditional systems require multiple tools, manual data gathering, and time-consuming analysis that delays critical investment decisions.
```

### ❌ Bad Example - Business Challenge
```markdown
**Business Challenge**: Portfolio managers need data.
```

### ✅ Good Example - User Input
```markdown
**User Input**: 
```
"What are my top 10 holdings by market value in the SAM Technology & Infrastructure portfolio?"
```
```

### ❌ Bad Example - User Input
```markdown
**User Input**: 
```
"SELECT * FROM holdings WHERE portfolio = 'tech'"
```
```

### ✅ Good Example - Expected Response
```markdown
**Expected Response**:
- Table showing: Ticker, Company Name, Weight %, Market Value USD
- Flag any positions >6.5% with "⚠️ CONCENTRATION WARNING"
- Include exact percentage and recommend monitoring or reduction
- Total exposure percentage of top 10
```

### ❌ Bad Example - Expected Response
```markdown
**Expected Response**:
- Show some data
```
